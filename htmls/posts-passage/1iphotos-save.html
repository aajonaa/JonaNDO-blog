              We often encounter storage problems when using an iphone. 64G and 128G are the most
              used storage devices because to level up the storage is too expensive. And the
              most storage-occupied app is photos, how can we store our photos to SSD
              without losing the high quality and more detailed information such as location,
              album and spot time. Here is what I am gonna tell you how to do it.
              Follow me step by step and picture by picture.
            </p>

            <div></div>

            <p>
              Before we dive into the specific process, let me simply explain what I am going to and
              the reasons why we do it. First we take pictures in iphoto and then the iphoto send the
              photo to the icloud server. Our Mac will syn the photos by downloading the photos from
              the icloud server, but the default setting may diff, so we should set the settings which
              I will detailed below. And then the Mac get the raw photos just like you see it in your
              iphone. We are just upload the photoslibrary file to the SSD which can be opened by Mac
              which maintains all the details and the structure. Now we delete the uploaded photos in
              our iphone because we get a copy of the photos and they stay in our SSD (Remember to
              delete the photos in your iphone photos trash). We spare the icloud space in this way
              because the deleted photos in your iphone will deleted in icloud. Actually there will be
              no photos in you icloud server if you successfully finished the above process. Now let us
              move to the Mac. Open photos in the way which provided below and then creat a new photoslibrary
              that end up with the photoslibrary extension. And set the new photoslibrary to be the system
              photoslibrary because only in this way we can syn photos from the icloud and download the
              original format to our Mac. Now delete the uploaded photoslibrary and if your iphone still
              have some photos that did not syned to icloud, it will syned to icloud automatically and
              then the Mac will download the photos from icloud and after it finished you can creat a
              new photoslibrary and set it system photoslibrary and upload the syned photoslibrary then
              delete it to spare space for your Mac.
            </p>

            <div></div>

            <p>
              Here is the detailed process demonstrated by pocessing picture in my Mac and iphone.
            </p>

            <div></div>

            <p>
              First of all, we should open photo app in Mac just like showed in Fig.1 (First make
              sure there is no photos app opend). 
            </p>
            <img src="../posts-passage/1iphotos-images/photos open page.png">
            <p class="fig-statement"><strong>Fig.1.</strong> Open photos App in this page</p>

            <div></div>

            <p>
              Open photos: click left button of mouse with the option keyboard pressed. The result
              showed in Fig.2 after you open photos in this way.
            </p>
            <img src="../posts-passage/1iphotos-images/after click the photos app.png">
            <p class="fig-statement"><strong>Fig.2.</strong> After click the photos App</p>

            <div></div>

            <p>
              Now we create a new photoslibrary and set it system photoslibrary showed in Fig.3.
              Here my now photoslibrary is called Photos Library 11.photoslibrary. Remember to end
              by the photoslibrary extension.
            </p>
            <img src="../posts-passage/1iphotos-images/creat a new photoslibrary.png">
            <p class="fig-statement"><strong>Fig.3.</strong> Create a new photoslibrary</p>

            <div></div>

            <p>
              Set the new photoslibrary to be the system photoslibrary. Demonstrated in
              Fig.4.
            </p>
            <img src="../posts-passage/1iphotos-images/set system photoslibrary.png">
            <p class="fig-statement"><strong>Fig.4.</strong> Set system photoslibrary</p>

            <div></div>

            <p>
              To download photos from icloud and download original format. Demonstrated in
              Fig.5.
            </p>
            <img src="../posts-passage/1iphotos-images/turn on download option.png">
            <p class="fig-statement"><strong>Fig.5.</strong> Turn on the downloading option</p>

            <div></div>

            <p>
              Now I have upload part of my photos to SSD and delete it from my iphone and
              then the icloud will delete it also. And set a new photoslibrary to syn the
              new photos that will upload to icloud because the icloud have spared some space
              because our deleting procedure which demonstrats in Fig.6.
            </p>
            <img src="../posts-passage/1iphotos-images/syning status of Mac and uploading status of iphone.png">
            <p class="fig-statement"><strong>Fig.6.</strong> Uploading status of iphone and Syn status of Mac</p>

            <div></div>

            <p>
              After Mac syn is finished which demonstrated in Fig.7 you can should copy the photoslibrary to you SSD
              which demonstrated in Fig.8. And now you have you server's photo in your SSD, so you should can delete
              your photos in your iphone and then the server's space will also be spared. After that, you should creat
              a new photoslibrary just like Fig.3 and set it be system photoslibrary just the same in Fig.4. The new
              photoslibrary will syn the new photos once there is new photo shotted by your iphone.
