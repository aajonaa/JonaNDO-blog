              You will learn how to draw vetor figure yourself for your paper using drawing tool Visio.
            </p>

            <div></div>

            <p>
              First you should open a new page in visio.
            </p>
            <img src="../posts-passage/5drawFigInPaper/1create a empty page in visio.png">

            <div></div>

            <p>
              Then select the desired Figure from the paper pdf and copy the Figure.
            </p>
            <img src="../posts-passage/5drawFigInPaper/2select the img that you want to draw.png">

            <div></div>

            <p>
              Paste the paper to the empty visio page.
            </p>
            <img src="../posts-passage/5drawFigInPaper/3paste the img in the visio and adjust its size.png">
            <p class="fig-statement"><strong>Fig.3.</strong> paste the img in the visio and adjust its size</p>

            <div></div>

            <p>
              Put the pasted Fig in the middle of the page and then imitate the Figure. First circle and then the irregular form.
            </p>
            <img src="../posts-passage/5drawFigInPaper/4just imitate the img that you wat to draw and use pencil to draw irregular form.png">

            <div></div>

            <p>
              After finish the regular form you should zoom in to draw the specific area.
            </p>

            <p>
              Make sure the irregular form is closed to let you fill some othre color. Usually we use pencil to draw
              the irregular form.
            </p>
            <img src="../posts-passage/5drawFigInPaper/6make sure the form you draw is closed to let you fill other color.png">

            <div></div>

            <p>
              Now fill the closed area some color.

            <div></div>

            <p>
              After you finish your framework you should use cursor tool to dray the Fig out of your drawing.

            <p>
              Now to click the little triangle of the form format to set the line style as no true line.
            </p>
            <img src="../posts-passage/5drawFigInPaper/9click the little triangle and set the line style no line to fit the desired design.png">

            <p>
              Finally finish the detail and fill the midd circle and put it the top layer.

            <p style="color: red;">Part II:How to fill the irregular formation</p>

            <div></div>

            <p>
              After you finished you design which means you get the desired formation you should combine the form and the connect it:
              dev-tool--opration--connect. You use dev-tool to connect in order to make the form be closed.
            </p>
            <img src="../posts-passage/5drawFigInPaper/11combine the form after get desired form.png">
            <p class="fig-statement"><strong>Fig.11.</strong> combine the form after get desired form</p>

            <div></div>

            <p>
              Select the desired area and then go to dev-tool to connect.
            </p>
            <img src="../posts-passage/5drawFigInPaper/12select the desired area and then connect.png">
            <p class="fig-statement"><strong>Fig.12.</strong> select the desired area and then connect</p>

            <div></div>

            <p>
              But sometimes you may find there were some lines in the middle of the formation which you want to remove, then you can
              remove it using click the start--pencil. The form will show all the point in the form after you click pencil and click it.
            </p>
            <img src="../posts-passage/5drawFigInPaper/13remove certain part after combined just click pencil.png">
            <p class="fig-statement"><strong>Fig.13.</strong> remove certain part after combined just click pencil</p>

            <div></div>

            <p>
              Now use del keyboard to delete the point that you do not want in the form. And then fill you close form some color to test
              whether it is closed, if it is not closed, you should reclick the pencil and then then the form to adjust the point to make
              the form close.
            </p>
