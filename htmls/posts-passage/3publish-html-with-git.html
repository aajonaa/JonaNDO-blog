            <p>
              I write my html file in VSCode and now I want publish it to the website, you can
              write you code remotely in this way. And now let's start to new a repository and
              publish my code to the repository which make the code gain the git version control
              and eventually publish my html in the website. Moreover, I will using look up to
              check my github sites ip, and add it to my domain name: jonawong.buzz with a subdomain
              sub which stands for subject I am learning. You should add a CNAME record to your
              github's sites (where your pages in) after you add ip to your domain which is A record.
              Don't worry about the word CNAME, it is just a alias of the domain name of your github
              page domain. There is one more thing needed to be done to make you own domain connected
              to github page, you will need to setting the page's cutom domain which may take some
              time to finish.
            </p>

              First make sure you have you html files and you open your folder in VSCode which shows
              in Fig.1 (index.html file is needed to publish your html files to website).

            <p>
              Now just copy the ip address and to manage your domain. Creating a A record 
              connect to the ip. My subdomain is subject and my domain name is <subject class="joanwong buzz">

            <div></div>

            <p>
              There is a CNAME record need to add as your alias of the subject.github.io to be the customed domain
